# COVID-Modeling
SEAIHDR Model for COVID pandemic, can be adapted to predict outcomes of any infectious disease outbreak

covid19_model_all.py includes the SEAIHDR model with numerical method of 4th order Runge Kutta. It also contains code to plot fractional values of SEAIHDR, cumulative deaths, and maximum hospitalizations.

Flattening_the_curve.py includes code to explore the effect of changing transmission rates on all dependent variables explored above. 

blunting_the_surge.py includes code that manipulate parameters in the SEAIHDR to explore the circumstances where we could blunt the surge and effectively prevent the outbreak from becoming an epidemic/pandemic.

R0_significance explores the effect of the R0 value on the outcome of the pandemic and underscores the importance of calculating and monitoring R0 during a pandemic.
